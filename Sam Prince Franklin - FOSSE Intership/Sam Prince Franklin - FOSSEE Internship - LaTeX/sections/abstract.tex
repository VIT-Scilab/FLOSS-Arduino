\LARGE The goal of the project is to create a distance measurement system that uses ultrasonic waves and is interfaced with an Arduino. The human hearing range is 20hz to 20khz, as we know. We may use the ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to use this frequency range waves. When this sensor is connected to an Arduino, which is a control and sensing device, a precise distance measurement may be achieved using innovative approaches. As large amounts are spent for hundreds of inflexible circuit boards, the Arduino will allow business to bring many more unique devices. This distance measurement system can be widely used as range meters and as proximity detectors in industries.  The ultrasonic sensor's hardware is connected to an Arduino. This method of measurement is a quick and accurate approach to measure short distances. An ultrasonic sensor is used to determine the distance between an obstruction and the sensor. The distance may be determined after the sound speed is known.  The project can be further continued by interfacing Ultrasonic Sensor with LED Display or 7 Segment display and getting outputs according to the distance. Further research can be made to make a human detection system for a house surveillance system.
